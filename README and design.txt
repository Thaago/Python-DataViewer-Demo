This demo project implements a simple GUI application that can: load and display time series data; compute and display its frequency vs time power spectral density; apply masking filters to the PSD and show the effect on the original time series.

It does this inside a venv python virtual environment for project compartmentalization - included is a guide to working with venv on windows that I wrote for some interested friends.

In order to run the demo, the virtual environment must be activated (using the activation script in venv/Scipts) before the main python app is run.
